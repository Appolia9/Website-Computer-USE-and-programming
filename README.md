Tasks 19-21. Game Theory
The task block consists of a general condition and three questions (19, 20, 21). 
The condition refers to players who are able to perform certain actions with a given pile or piles of stones.
The task is to find the initial number of stones in the pile.
The conditions can be divided into 2 groups: participants play with one pile and with two piles.\
\
**Task 1 (one pile of stones) DEMO-2023:**\
Two players, Petya and Vanya, play the following game. There is a pile of stones in front of the players.
The players take turns, with Petya making the first move. In one turn, the player can add one stone to the pile or double the number of stones in the pile.
In order to make moves, each player has an unlimited number of stones. The game ends when the number of stones in the pile becomes at least 129. 
The winner is the player who made the last move, i.e. the first to receive a pile of 129 or more stones. At the beginning, there were S stones in the pile, 1 ≤ S ≤ 128.
Let's say that a player has a winning strategy if he can win with any moves of the opponent.\
**19**. Specify a value of S such that Petya cannot win in one move, but with any move Petya Vanya can win with his first move.\
**20**. For the game described in task 19, find the two smallest values of S for which Petya has a winning strategy, and two conditions are met simultaneously:
– Petya cannot win in one move; – Petya can win with his second move, regardless of how Vanya moves.
Write down the found values in the answer in ascending order.\
**21**. For the game described in task 19, find the minimum value of S at which two conditions are simultaneously fulfilled:
– Vanya has a winning strategy that allows him to win on the first or second move in any game of Petya;
– Vanya does not have a strategy that will allow him to win with a guaranteed first move.
If several values of S are found, write down the minimum of them in the response.\
\
**Task 2 (two piles of stones) DEMO 2020:**
Two players, Petya and Vanya, play the following game. There are two piles of stones in front of the players.
The players take turns, with Petya making the first move. In one turn, the player can add one stone to one of the piles (at his choice) or increase the number of stones
in the pile three times. For example, let's say there are 10 stones in one pile and 7 stones in the other; this position in the game will be denoted by (10, 7).
Then in one move you can get any of the four positions: (11, 7), (30, 7), (10, 8), (10, 21). In order to make moves, each player has an unlimited number of stones.
The game ends at the moment when the total number of stones in the piles becomes at least 68. The winner is the player who made the last move, i.e.
the first to get a position in which there will be 68 or more stones in the piles.
At the beginning, there were 6 stones in the first pile, and S stones in the second pile; 1 ≤ S ≤ 61.
Let's say that a player has a winning strategy if he can win with any moves of the opponent.\
**19**. a) Specify all such values of the number S at which Petya can win in one move. 
b) It is known that Vanya won with his first move after Petya's unsuccessful first move.
Specify the minimum value of S when this situation is possible.\
**20**. Specify a value of S at which Petya has a winning strategy, and two conditions are met simultaneously: − Petya cannot win in one move; 
− Petya can win with his second move, regardless of how Vanya walks.\
**21**. Specify the S value at which two conditions are simultaneously fulfilled: 
− Vanya has a winning strategy that allows him to win on the first or second move in any game of Petya;
− Vanya does not have a strategy that will allow him to win with a guaranteed first move
